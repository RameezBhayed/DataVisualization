# DataVisualization
Introduction:
In this project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset containing information about penguin species, their physical characteristics, and their distribution across different islands. The objective was to gain insights into the penguin population and understand the variations in their physical attributes.

Data Preprocessing:

Data Cleaning: I started by reading the dataset from a CSV file and immediately addressed the presence of "NA" values, replacing them with NaN (Not-a-Number) to facilitate further data cleaning.
Handling Missing Data: To ensure data quality, I removed rows with missing values, resulting in a more refined dataset.
Data Type Conversion: I validated and converted the numerical columns ('culmen_length_mm', 'culmen_depth_mm', 'flipper_length_mm', 'body_mass_g') to numeric data types, correcting any inconsistencies.
Duplicate Removal: To prevent data redundancy, I removed duplicate rows from the dataset.
Data Analysis:

Species Distribution: I visualized the distribution of penguin species using a count plot, which revealed the relative abundance of Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap penguins. However, I emphasized the importance of cautious interpretation due to potential sampling biases.

Body Mass Distribution: A box plot was employed to display the distribution of body mass by penguin species. The plot indicated that Gentoo penguins tend to be the heaviest, while Adelie and Chinstrap penguins exhibited similar median body mass. Chinstrap penguins were identified as the only species with outliers.

Pairwise Relationships: I utilized a pair plot to explore relationships between numeric attributes. The plot revealed correlations, such as the positive correlation between body mass and flipper length. It also demonstrated that longer flipper length was associated with less culmen depth.

Body Mass Distribution: A histogram with KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) illustrated the distribution of body mass across all penguins. The graph highlighted common body mass ranges and showcased the presence of outliers, with one at 6200 grams and another at 2300 grams.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, this project conducted a comprehensive exploratory analysis of penguin physical characteristics. It involved data cleaning, visualization, and interpretation. While the dataset provided valuable insights into penguin species and their attributes, it also emphasized the importance of considering potential sampling biases when drawing conclusions about penguin population sizes. The observed variations in body mass and other attributes underscored the diversity within the penguin species, offering a foundation for further research and analysis.
